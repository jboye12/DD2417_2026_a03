        Function returning k nearest neighbors with distances for each word
        in `words`
        
        We suggest using nearest neighbors implementation from scikit-learn.
        Carefully check the documentation regarding the parameters passed to
        the algorithm.
    
        Imagine you want to find 5 nearest neighbors for the words "Harry"
        and "Potter" using some distance metric `m`. For that you would need
        to call `self.find_nearest(["Harry", "Potter"], k=5, metric='m')`.

        The output of the function would then be the following list of lists
        of tuples (LLT) (all words and distances are just example values):
    
        [[('Harry', 0.0), ('Hagrid', 0.07), ('Snape', 0.08),
          ('Dumbledore', 0.08), ('Hermione', 0.09)],
         [('Potter', 0.0), ('quickly', 0.21), ('asked', 0.22), ('lied', 0.23),
          ('okay', 0.24)]]
        
        The i-th element of the list would correspond to the k nearest neighbors
        for the i-th word in the `words` input list. Each tuple contains a word
        and a distance. The tuples are sorted either by ascending distance.
        
        :param      words:   Words for the nearest neighbors to be found
        :type       words:   list
        :param      metric:  The similarity/distance metric
